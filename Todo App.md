# ToDoApp_Using_MERN
In this repo I just implement Todo functionality in fully functional way with backend support.
You just need to clone this code and replace your database link in .env file in server side. After replacing just run app with (nodemon index) and in client side to run just type in terminal (npm run dev)
to run frontend app. After All stepsyou will see magic.ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
